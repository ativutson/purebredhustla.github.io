# The Music Artist Database 

This [web app] (https://purebredhustla-github-io.vercel.app/) allows users to look up general information about any artists such as label, genre, and short bio.

# Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- Google Fonts
- GitHub
- Digital Color Meter
- The AudioDB API

# Approach

[The AudioDB API] (https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php) is integrated using JQuery which pulls the free basic data with a free test API key. The image in the banner of the web page is provided by www.unsplash.com. The footer color is matched with the banner color using Digital Color Meter on Mac. Raleway downloaded from Google Fonts in the main font.

# Future improvements

- The text between the ```<p>``` tags should be closer.
- The URLs should be clickable links.
- The text in main section should be hidden when there is no data provided.
- The banner height should be shorter and still not hide the model.
- The search bar can be more interactive and playful.
